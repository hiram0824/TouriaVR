TouriaVR is an innovative virtual reality (VR) tourism application that addresses the
limitations of traditional travel by offering immersive and accessible experiences. This
project leverages VR technology, with a strong foundation in Unreal Engine, to provide users
with the opportunity to explore diverse destinations, all from the comfort of their VR
headsets. By capturing high-quality 360-degree content and offering interactive features,
TouriaVR empowers users to embark on virtual journeys enriched with historical and
cultural insights. This paper outlines the project's objectives, methodologies, design details,
cost analysis, testing, and relevant literature. Drawing insights from recent research,
TouriaVR aims to revolutionize the tourism industry, offering a cost-effective and engaging
solution for users seeking to overcome barriers to travel, such as financial limitations,
security concerns, health restrictions, and bureaucratic complexities. TouriaVR's use of
Unreal Engine 5 serves as the technological backbone, enabling the delivery of photorealistic
graphics and interactive content, further enhancing the user's virtual tourism experience.
